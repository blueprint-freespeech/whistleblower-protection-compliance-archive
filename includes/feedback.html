    <h4>EUDC Feedback</h4>
    <p>The EU Directive adopts a broad, horizontal approach that ties whistleblower protection to the working of the
        Single Market and matters affecting the financial interests of the Union. This means that the Directive
        comes close to covering everything the EU could legislate on.</p>

</div>
<div id="ISC_fb_sec1_q1" class="feedbackSection hidden">
    <h4>ISC Feedback</h4>
    <p>Issues outside of EU competence are not covered by the Directive, and the decision to extend reportable
        wrongdoing on other matters is reserved to EU Member States. The Directive includes an explicit carve out
        for national security matters. Nevertheless, the Directive is clear that it should be regarded as a minimum
        standard and that Member States can provide stronger and more expansive protections if they wish. </p>
    <p>Best practice is to ensure that all whistleblowers, including in the national security, police and
        intelligence sectors, do have some form of recourse, whether that be to a specialised internal mechanism or
        to an oversight institution.</p>

    <h4>ISC Feedback</h4>
    <p>The Directive encourages Member States to go over and above what is required. In order to ensure that the
        scope of whistleblower protections are intelligible to non-specialists, they should be extended to cover
        matters covered in national legislation only.</p>
    <p>Member States may also wish to consider whether whistleblower reports about breaches of ethics codes and
        similar standards that do not have legal status should be protected.</p>

<div id="EUDC_fb_sec1_q3" class="feedbackSection hidden">
    <h4>EUDC Feedback</h4>
    <p>The Directive defines a breach as an act or omission that is either unlawful or defeats the object or purpose
        of the law. Omissions in this sense should include purposeful omissions (not enforcing regulations) as well
        as non-purposeful ones (negligence). Protection extents to information on potential breaches or efforts to
        cover them up.</p>

    <p>Waste and inefficiencies do not necessarily result from negligence and are an example of issues that may well
        form the subject matter of valuable reports but are not explicitly covered by the Directive. This may be an
        area where Member States or individual organisations wish to expand on the Directive standards.</p>
    <p>In any case, the Directive provides that a whistleblower is entitled to protection if they had reasonable
        grounds to believe that their report was within the scope of the Directive.</p>

    <p>The personal scope of the Directive is very broad and covers anyone who acquires information on breaches in a
        work-related context – that includes shareholders, former employees, volunteers and those going through a
        recruitment process. “Work-related context” should be interpreted broadly: it does not matter what the
        nature of those activities are.</p>

    <p>The requirement for information to have been acquired in the context of work activities does, nevertheless,
        means that the Directive falls short of protecting all citizens. A hospital patient would not be covered,
        nor someone who witnesses a wrongful arrest. Some proposals recommend extending coverage in this area.
        Whistleblowing schemes that are open to the public already exist in some EU Member States, such as France
        and Spain. </p>

    <p>The Directive requires that someone making a report should have acquired that information in the course of
        their work-related activities and that the information concerns an organisation they are or have been in
        contact with.</p>
    <p>There is no requirement for a whistleblower to be in a direct working relationship with the subject of their
        report, or to have been in one in the past.</p>

    <p>Good faith requirements are onerous for whistleblowers and their absence from the Directive is deliberate.
        Neither are whistleblowers required to establish their allegations to a legal standard of proof.</p>
    <p>A whistleblower is required only to have reasonable grounds to believe that the information in their report
        is true. If an investigation later determines that a report is not well-founded, the person who made that
        report does not lose their entitlement to protection.</p>
    <p>Knowingly false reports or public disclosures are not protected by the Directive and may be subject to
        penalties. </p>

    <h4>ISC Feedback</h4>
    <p>Whistleblowers who are entitled to protection under the Directive rules can seek dismissal of legal
        proceedings on a range of grounds, including defamation, breach of copyright, data protection and disclosure
        of trade secrets.</p>
    <p>The situation is slightly more complicated when it comes to criminal liability. The Directive provides that
        there is an exemption to general immunity from prosecution if the acquisition or access of information does
        not constitute a “self-standing criminal offence.”</p>
    <p>This clause provides a potential of legal uncertainty. It is not uncommon for the acquisition of internal
        information a whistleblower relies on in their report to be characterised as theft. Preventing these kinds
        of legal vexatious proceedings was, in fact, one of the inspirations behind the Directive.</p>
    <p>The Directive recitals clarify the situation somewhat, specifying physical trespass and computer misuse as
        examples where national criminal law should apply. Nevertheless, care should be taken here too.</p>
    <p>Computer misuse laws are typically expansive and lack a public interest test. It is likely that many
        disclosures related to data protection or network security – both areas that are explicitly covered by the
        Directive – could also constitute technical breaches of computer crimes statutes.</p>
    <p>If immunity is not to be extended to these areas, then national courts should carefully consider the
        necessity and proportionality of such actions in relation to the report or public disclosure at issues. </p>

<div id="EUDC_fb_sec2_q5" class="feedbackSection hidden">
    <h4>EUDC Feedback</h4>
    <p>The Directive recognises that not only do whistleblowers often seek the assistance of third parties, those
        individuals and organisations can themselves become the subject of retaliation. Relatives and colleagues of
        the whistleblower and legal entities directly connected to the whistleblower are entitled to all the
        protections the Directive provides.</p>
    <p>There is also a provision for the protection of “facilitators”, who are defined as natural persons who
        “assist a reporting person in the reporting process” in a confidential manner.</p>
    <p class="articleref">See Directive 4(4), 5(8)</p>

</div>
<div id="ISC_fb_sec2_q5" class="feedbackSection hidden">
    <h4>ISC Feedback</h4>
    <p>The facilitators provision excludes legal entities, but it is open to Member States to improve on the
        baseline protections in the Directive. Consideration could be given to whether legal entities – such as
        media organisations, NGOs and professional organisations should also be granted protection.</p>

</div>

<div id="EUDC_fb_sec3_q1" class="feedbackSection hidden">
    <h4>EUDC Feedback</h4>
    <p>The ability of whistleblowers to make a choice about where to make a report – whether to their employer, to
        an external regulator or, in more limited circumstances, to the media – is a key feature of the Directive.
    </p>
    <p>Mandatory internal reporting – an obligation for a whistleblower to make a report to their employer before
        having recourse anywhere else – was a contentious issue while the Directive was being concluded. It was
        ultimately rejected.
    </p>
    <p>While the overwhelming majority of whistleblowers - over 90% - will typically make an internal report first,
        the ability to have initial recourse to a regulator is critical in the minority of cases where an employer
        is likely to disregard a report or, worse, penalise the whistleblower and destroy evidence when alerted to
        wrongdoing.</p>
    <p>The Directive allows Member States to encourage internal reporting, but not at the expense of providing full
        information about when a whistleblower might choose to go elsewhere.</p>
    <p>Meeting the required standard in this area of the Directive is an essential part of an effective
        transposition.</p>
    <p>The US experience showed that the absence of mandatory internal channels overloads competent authorities with
        false or
        irrelevant reports.</p>
    <p class="articleref">See Directive 7, 10, 15</p>

</div>
<div id="ISC_fb_sec3_q1" class="feedbackSection hidden">
    <h4>ISC Feedback</h4>
    <p>The Directive also regulates the creation and functioning of external channels, typically defined as
        Competent authorities.</p>
    <p>Some reporting routes are not explicitly mentioned in the Directive, for instance national governmental or
        representative bodies. Given that recourse to EU institutions or agencies is defined as external reporting
        in the Directive, there may be merit in defining a similar situation for domestic institutions in national
        law.</p>
    <p>Existing rights to go to law enforcement or trades unions should not be affected by the Directive.</p>

<div id="ISC_fb_sec3_q2_a" class="feedbackSection hidden">
    <h4>ISC Feedback</h4>
    <p>A large number of whistleblowing cases involve individuals being penalised for communicating information as part of their normal work duties. This is particularly the case for those in compliance, audit and health and safety roles. Creating a specific protected channel for whistleblower disclosures should not leave work-related speech that happens elsewhere vulnerable to retaliation. While the Directive’s recitals state that duty speech is protected, member states may want to ensure this is explicit in transposition.</p>

</div>

<div id="EUDC_fb_sec3_q2" class="feedbackSection hidden">
    <h4>EUDC Feedback</h4>
    <p>One of the most significant provisions of the Directive is the obligation it places on employers to set up
        secure and confidential internal channels to handle whistleblowing reports.</p>
    <p>Private and public sector organisations employing 50 or more people are obliged to set up these channels.
        This does not override existing obligations for companies in some sectors (such as financial services) where
        these are more onerous.</p>
    <p>Member States have the option of exempting municipalities with less than 10,000 inhabitants from these
        requirements.</p>
    <p>Organisations in the private sector employing fewer than 250 people are allowed to share resources for the
        receipt and investigation of reports, as long as all the requirements for internal channels are met.</p>
    <p class="articleref">See Directive 8(1, 3-6, 9)</p>

</div>
<div id="ISC_fb_sec3_q2" class="feedbackSection hidden">
    <h4>ISC Feedback</h4>
    <p>Member States have the option of extending these requirements to private sector entities employing fewer than
        50 people. The Directive suggests this may be appropriate for the management of risks to public health and
        the environment in particular organisations.</p>
    <p>Where Member States wish to extend internal channel obligations in this way, they are obliged to notify the
        Commission with their reasons and criteria relied on in their risk assessment.</p>
    <p>Non-profits are not specifically mentioned in the Directive but might be best considered as a subset of legal
        entities in the private sector.</p>

    <p>Private sector organisations are allowed to contract third parties to operate internal reporting channels on

</div>
<div id="ISC_fb_sec3_q3" class="feedbackSection hidden">

    <p>Where whistleblowing channels are contracted out to third parties, there is the potential for conflict of
        interest and detriment caused to whistleblowers as a result. Consideration should be given to whether
        minimum standards should be set down in law, as they are in the Netherlands.</p>

</div>

<div id="EUDC_fb_sec3_q4" class="feedbackSection hidden">
    <h4>EUDC Feedback</h4>
    <p>The Directive sets out some specific requirements for how internal channels should operate. They are supposed
        to be designed with confidentiality in mind and made the specific responsibility of an individual or
        department.</p>
    <p>There must be scope for reports to be made in writing, orally and in person, if that is requested.</p>
    <p>Those charged with operating the channel are expected to keep communication with the whistleblower open. A
        reporting person is entitled to have their report acknowledged within seven days and receive feedback within
        three months.</p>
    <p class="articleref">See Directive 9</p>

</div>
<div id="ISC_fb_sec3_q4" class="feedbackSection hidden">
    <h4>ISC Feedback</h4>
    <p>Internal channels must be open to employees, but organisations have the option of opening their
        whistleblowing to others who do have been in contact with it in the course of their working activities. This
        includes volunteers, contractors and shareholders.</p>
    <p>Facilitating anonymous reporting is suggested as an option in the Directive. The use of online dropboxes
        allows for anonymous reporting that maintains a means of communication between the whistleblower and the
        person receiving the report.</p>
    <p>Training for those operating internal channels is not required under the Directive but, given that it is
        mandatory for those operating external channels, it should be regarded as best practice.</p>
    <p>Similarly, while there is a requirement for those operating internal channels to keep records for the purpose
        of investigating reports, there is no obligation to maintain or publish statistics on the number of reports
        received and outcome of investigations. Employers may wish to consider doing so as a means of showing that
        their measures are working as intended.</p>
    <p class="articleref">See Directive 8(2)</p>
</div>

<div id="EUDC_fb_sec3_q5" class="feedbackSection hidden">
    <h4>EUDC Feedback</h4>
    <p>Requirements for external channels under the Directive are similar to those for internal channels, but more
        onerous in some respects. This reflects not only that external channels are likely to handle the most
        serious initial reports and those escalated from internal channels.</p>
    <p>Those operating external channels are expected to provide training to those dealing with whistleblower
        complaints and have set procedures for transmitting reports to those best placed to investigate them. Those
        procedures need to be set up in specified manners regarding the granting of confidentiality of personal
        data, reporting and accessibility. </p>
    <p>Member States are granted significant freedom in the institutional design of external whistleblowing schemes
        and may explicitly consider the introduction of dedicated independent oversight. </p>
    <p>EU regulators have included “relevant institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the Union” as eligible
        recipients for external reports, which suggests national agencies should be treated in the same way.</p>

</div>

<div id="ISC_fb_sec3_q6" class="feedbackSection hidden">
    <h4>ISC Feedback</h4>
    <p>What constitutes a public disclosure for the purposes of the Directive is not defined. While much discussion
        of public reporting focuses on the relationship between whistleblowers and journalists, there is nothing
        that says that journalists necessarily have to be involved in such disclosures.</p>
    <p>Direct publication, for instance the publication of an op-ed, a blog or a post on social media, should also
        be understood as types of public reporting.</p>
    <p class="articleref">See Directive 15</p>
</div>

<div id="EUDC_fb_sec3_q7" class="feedbackSection hidden">
    <h4>EUDC Feedback</h4>
    <p>While whistleblowers are able to make their report public in the first instance, the Directive sets a high
        bar for this. A report must either “constitute an imminent or manifest danger to the public interest” with
        the risk of emergency or serious damage, or the whistleblower has reason to believe that using other
        channels will be fruitless or risky.</p>
    <p>Public reporting is also protected in situations where other reporting channels have been tried and no
        appropriate action has been taken in the given timeframe. The Directive recitals clarify that this covers
        situations where investigations have been conducted but appropriate remedial action has not been taken. If a
        report has been wrongly assessed as being of minor importance, the recitals suggest this may be a reason to
        go public.</p>
    <p>Where national laws already offer greater protections – for instance in Sweden, where source protection is
        guaranteed at a constitutional level – these are not affected by the Directive.</p>

</div>
<div id="ISC_fb_sec3_q7" class="feedbackSection hidden">
    <h4>ISC Feedback</h4>
    <p>Courts are likely to interpret “imminent or manifest danger” narrowly. Member states may therefore wish to
        consider whether the Directive’s treatment of public reporting offers effective protection to whistleblowers
        who have information on issues of considerable public importance. To strengthen legal certainty, clear
        definitions of what constitutes imminent or manifest dangers to the public interest should be included. </p>

<div id="EUDC_fb_sec4_q1" class="feedbackSection hidden">
    <h4>EUDC Feedback</h4>
    <p>Notwithstanding the prominence of anonymous disclosures in public debates around whistleblowing, the
        provision of anonymous reporting channels was a contentious issue during Directive negotiations.</p>
    <p>The Directive contains one firm commitment on anonymity, to ensure that whistleblowers who make anonymous
        reports are not deprived of protections. Where the identity of someone who has made an anonymous report
        becomes known, they are entitled to the same duty of confidentiality and protections against retaliation as
        whistleblowers who have used other channels.</p>

</div>
<div id="ISC_fb_sec4_q1" class="feedbackSection hidden">

    <p>Beyond this commitment, the Directive suggests that Member States consider whether to require internal or

</div>

<div id="EUDC_fb_sec4_q2" class="feedbackSection hidden">
    <h4>EUDC Feedback</h4>
    <p>The duty of confidentiality is a key part of the Directive. A key characteristic of ineffective or
        compromised reporting channels is that they communicate the identity of a whistleblower to those who are the
        subject of their report.</p>
    <p>The Directive therefore lays down detailed rules about the treatment of personal data and the need for this
        to be restricted to authorised persons. Those operating reporting channels have a responsibility to comply
        with data protection rules, with the purpose of information collection in this context to be to ensure that
        an investigation can be properly carried out.</p>
    <p>Confidentiality applies not only to personal data, but also to other information from which the identity of
        the reporting person could be deduced.</p>
    <p>There should be penalties for those who breach this duty of confidentiality.</p>

    <h4>ISC Feedback</h4>
    <p>An additional means of protecting against breaches of confidentiality is to allow whistleblowers to make
        their report anonymously. Member States should consider mandating the provision of options for anonymous
        reporting and ensuring that such reports are investigated.</p>
    <p>Encrypted online drop-box systems allow for follow up of anomymous reports, which greatly assists
        investigation.</p>

    <p>There are limited exemptions from the general duty of confidentiality, for the purpose of investigating a

    <p>A whistleblower’s identity may be disclosed if they give explicit consent or if it is assessed to be
        “necessary and proportionate” for investigation purposes, in the context of national law. Where this is the
        case, a whistleblower should be sent notification and an explanation in writing.</p>
    <p>“Disclosure” in this context means disclosure to indivduals who are not authorised staff members, rather than

        likely to already be present in most EU jurisdictions.</p>
    <p>Where a new course of action or criminal offence is proposed, this may impact freedom of expression rights as
        well as whistleblower protection. Such proposals require very careful examination.</p>

    <p>Many kinds of support for whistleblowers are envisioned in the Directive, but most are optional and left up
        to the discretion of Member States to put into law.</p>
    <p>Obligatory elements include the provision of free and independent advice. Internal channels must make
        information on how to make a report and methods of recourse available to employees. Operators of external
        channels must publish information online.</p>
    <p>Member States are also obliged to provide legal aid to whistleblowers in criminal and cross-border civil
        proceedings.</p>

    <p>Member States may wish to consider whether the compulsory legal aid requirement in the Directive is
        comprehensive enough to cover all the types of legal action a whistleblower might be subjected to. In
        particular, consideration should be given to the costs a whistleblower might encounter during employment and
        other civil proceedings.</p>
    <p>Other types of support Member States may choose to provide include health and psychological support, interim
        relief and financial assistance. They may wish to introduce a certification scheme whereby a whistleblower
        can demonstrate their status pending investigation.</p>
    <p>Member States may also establish a dedicated agency responsible for providing whistleblowers with information
        or support.</p>

    <p>The Directive includes an assertion of basic rule of law principles for those who are the subject of reports
        (“persons concerned”), including the presumption of innocence and a fair trial. There is a duty of
        confidentiality towards persons concerned as there is for whistleblowers.</p>

    <p>One area for remedy that requires careful consideration are penalties for those who use whistleblowing
        channels to make knowingly false reports, or disclose such information publicly.</p>
    <p>Care should be taken to ensure that the approach taken here is proportionate and does not act as a
        disincentive to those who are considering making a report, as that would defeat the point of the Directive.

    <p>Laws against defamation are likely to already be present in most EU jurisdictions. Where a new course of

    <p>The Directive establishes record-keeping duties for operators of internal and external channels in order to
        ensure that investigations can be conducted properly.
    </p>
    <p>Operators of external channels are expected to keep records of the individual report, which can be inspected
        by the whistleblower on request, together with aggregated data on the total number of reports received, the
        outcome of investigations and the funds recovered as a result.
    </p>
    <p>The standards for internal channels are less onerous and require only that proper records of reports be taken
        for the purposes of an investigation.</p>

    <p>Operators of internal channels may wish to consider keeping aggregated statistics on the number of records
        received and outcomes. There may be a reputational value in doing so, in addition to building confidence in
        the system.</p>
    <p>We suggest that in addition to keeping records of investigation outcomes, operators of external channels
        record the reasons for not launching investigations. Large numbers of reports are being closed as trivial or
        repetitive may warrant further investigation.</p>

    <p>The Directive mandates the collection of certain statistics on the national level. These include the total
        number of reports received by external channels and the number of investigations launched on the basis of
        those reports together with an estimate of the financial loss caused by the matters under discussion and any
        funds recovered.</p>

    <p>It may also be valuable to aggregate data on the outcome of reports and any legal proceedings initiated in

        report.</p>

    <p>The European Commission intends to conduct a review of how the legislation is operating after four years.</p>
    <p>The Directive does not stipulate what review processes should take place at the national level, other than
        that certain statistics should be recorded and that a review of external channels needs to take place at
        least every three years.
    </p>
    <p>In practice civil society plays an important role in reviewing how national systems are working and we can
        expect that to continue.</p>
